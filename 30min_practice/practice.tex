We have not added a title, author and date to our first \LaTeX{} document!
First document. This is a simple example, with no
extra parameters or packages included.

Some of the \textbf{greatest} athletes are the best people.

One of my favorite books is \textit{Angels and Deamons} by Dan Brown

To add stress to a word people my underline something like \underline{this}.

Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} in science were made by accident.

\textit{Some of the greatest \emph{disoveries} in science were made by accident.}

\textbf{Some of the greatest \emph{discoveries} in science were made by mistake}

    \label{fig:head1}
\end{figure}

As you can see in the figure \ref{fig:head1}, this is a picture when Brent
had blonde hair. Also, on page \pageref{fig:head1} is the same example.

    \item The individual entries are indicated with a black dot, a so-called bullet.
    \item The text in the entries may be of any length

    \item This is the first entry in the list
    \item The list numbers increase with each entry we add

In physics, the mass-engery equivalence is stated by the equation
$E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.

The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation
\[ E=mc^2 \]
discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
In natural units ($c = 1$), the formula expresses the identity
\begin{equation}
    E=m
\end{equation}

Subscripts in math mode are written as $a_b$ and superscripts are written as $a^b$. These can be combined an nested to write expressions such as

\[ T^{i_1 i_2 \dots i_p}_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_q} = T(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_p},e_{j_1},\dots,e_{j_q}) \]
 
We write integrals using $\int$ and fractions using $\frac{a}{b}$. Limits are placed on integrals using superscripts and subscripts:

\[ \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{e^x} =  \frac{e-1}{e} \]

Lower case Greek letters are written as $\omega$ $\delta$ etc. while upper case Greek letters are written as $\Omega$ $\Delta$.

Mathematical operators are prefixed with a backslash as $\sin(\beta)$, $\cos(\alpha)$, $\log(x)$ etc.

\begin{abstract}
    This is a simple paragraph at the beginning of the document.
    A brief introduction to the main subject.
\end{abstract}

Now the we have written our abstract, we can begin writing our first paragraph.

This line will start a second paragraph.
